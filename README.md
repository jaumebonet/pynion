Pynion
=========

A small minion library to build libraries.  
The **pynion** library provides a series of helper classes to build projects.
It also includes a master controller class ``Manager`` able to distribute
execution preferences through both the main code of a script of a full library.
Amongst others, it manages:  
    *  *Logging depth*  
    *  *Overwrite control*  
    *  *Clean up of temporal and empty files*  

Find more about how to use the library in the [documentation](https://pynion.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
